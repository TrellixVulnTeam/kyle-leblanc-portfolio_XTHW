# Portfolio-Site
 


The Professional Portfolio Website of Kyle Jorden Rene LeBlanc

This is my first website and one that I intend to extend the functionality of over time as I expand my skillset and knowledge. 
This is a great way for me to show my growth over time as well to potential employers so they can see what I created with only self taught knowledge 
and how I expanded that knowledge throughout the Web Developer Bootcamp that I am attending in May. I intend to upset and continue to improve upon my projects
to have a catalogue of projects to showcase to potential employers.



Some code will work, but may not be the optimal way of achieving the desired outcome, but that's okay as I hope to go back and update some of the code as I learn
new techniques and better coding practices over time. This way, I can learn to re-iterate over my old code as well.
