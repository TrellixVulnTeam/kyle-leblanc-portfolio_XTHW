                            I decided to choose web development as a way to refine my learning to a narrow area to be able to be confident enough to begin the job search while continuing to learn new skills as I have been. I have the strongest foundation of knowledge in this sector, with excellent HTML & CSS skills (it's pretty easy) and an intermediate knowledge of javascript. Some experience with React.js & bootstrap but wanted to learn vanilla first

                           Strong foundation of knowledge of programming principles across languages. I have had time specifically learning C++, python, javascript, and C#. Some of these languages as you may know have similar syntax which makes it easier once you have the foundation of programming principles. I have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms after countless hours of learning.

                            I have been learning the fundamentals of the Cyber Security field in recent months. I am not committing the same time as the others, but I believe it can be extremely valuable to have a background in security so that one can be mindful of security flaws and vulnerabilites while writing the code itself. Most vulnerabilites are implemented due to human errors in the code itself. Something that was overlooked.

                <p>
                    My name is Kyle LeBlanc and I am a self taught developer currently living in Ottawa Ontario. I have been toying with the idea of becoming a      developer for many years without a real commitment. I started college right out of high school for video game development but didn't complete it due to financial issues among others. To be completely honest, I wasn't ready right out of school I realize now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since that time, I have spent my time learning new skills that would allow me to enter a career in the technology sector. I have considered going back to college to receive a computer science degree, however I am an excellent self taught learner, and while I believe it would be a good investment. I believe that I can achieve my goals without it, by demonstrating my dedication, learning abilities to acquire additional skills or languages, and my passion for creating things that matter to peoples lives.
