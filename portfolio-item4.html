            <p>
                I want to build applications that will help many people with some issue they were having, some small some large, but that had an effect nonetheless. I have spent some time learning and building small projects, but I don't feel any of them are worthy to showcase, instead I am simply addmitting that I did not build enough in my learning journey, and to make an effort now to change that. I am working on the websites which I find much easier, while I continue to pursue a firm grasp in software development. I believe I have a firm understanding of the principles of programming and the data structures used, as I have been studying for, and will be taking the MTA software developer exam 38-361 by the end of the month to fortify my portfolio and continue to expand my career opportunities.

                The link to the source code will take you to the github repo that I will be actively working on, and you will be able to see the progress at the very least, and to see my commitment to continuing to commit to the repos, and begin to actively engage with github far more than I had been previously. I now understand that I was making a huge mistake by not learning github earlier, and not actively engaging in commits even if they were small projects, or commits to open source projects, that I could have used that to demonstrate my continued learning and dedication to pursuing my career in technology and beyond.
